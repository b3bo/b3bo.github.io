# Neighborhoods

This folder contains **public-facing files** for the Neighborhood Finder application.

## Source
Files are generated and deployed from the private **NeighborhoodFinder** repository.

## Contents

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `js/` | Application JavaScript (10 files, deployed from NF) |
| `css/` | Compiled CSS (`styles.css` + `tailwind_neighborhoods.css`) |
| `jsons/` | b64 encoded marker data + geojson boundary data |
| `img/` | Favicons and static images for CF |

## Deployment
Files are deployed using `scripts/csv_pathway/3_deploy_map.bat` from the NeighborhoodFinder repo.

**Deployment copies:**
- `assets/html/index.html` → `/index.html` (root)
- `assets/js/*.js` → `/neighborhoods/js/`
- `assets/css/*.css` → `/neighborhoods/css/`
- `assets/jsons/*.json.b64` → `/neighborhoods/jsons/`
- `assets/jsons/*.geojson` → `/neighborhoods/jsons/`

**Do not edit these files directly** - they are deployed from the private repo.
